# Waris solutions for Advent of Code

Every year [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) publishes 50 puzzles.
In this repository I try to use a different programming language every year to solve them.
This project is not about best practices or code quality.
It's about writing single use programs to solve specific problems.
So don't expect maintainable code that covers edge cases in this repository.
Many solutions will probably even break if you change the input slightly.
