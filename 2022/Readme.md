# 2022 - Java

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java%20version-17-b07219)

2022 was the first year I tried to solve the puzzles of Advent of Code.
At that time I already knew Java quite well, so it was just about solving the puzzles.

## Setup

First, you need to install a JDK with version 17, as this was the latest version in december 2022.
Each folder (`day01`, `day02`, ...) contains at least two files called `Part1.java` and `Part2.java`.
To run these, create a new file called `input` in the same folder and fill it with the contents of the given data (your
puzzle input).
Run these commands inside the folder to start the programs for part 1 and 2 of the puzzles of day 1:

```bash
javac Part1.java
java de.wariashi.aoc.day01.Part1

javac Part2.java
java de.wariashi.aoc.day01.Part2
```

(Or just click on the play button in your favorite IDE. It's probably easier.)
