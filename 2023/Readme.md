## Setup

First, you need to install Gradle 8.5 as this was the latest version in december 2023.
To run the program, you also need to create new files with the given data (your puzzle input) for each day.
So for the first day create the file `app/src/main/resources/day01/input` and so on.
Run this command to start the program for all puzzles:

```bash
gradle run
```

If you also want to run the tests, you need to create new files with the example data for each day.
The file names depend on whether the example is the same for part 1 and 2.
So for the first day create the files `app/src/main/resources/day01/example_1` and
`app/src/main/resources/day01/example2`.
For the second day create the file `app/src/main/resources/day01/example` and so on.
Run this command to start the tests for all puzzles:

```bash
gradle test
```
