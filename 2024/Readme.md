# 2024 - Python

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20version-3.13-3572A5)

2024 was the first year I tried to learn a new programming language with Advent of Code.
So here you can see me discover functions on day 2, classes, enums and imports on day 6, the existence of a main
function on day 8 and eventually numpy on day 18.

## Setup

First, you need to install Python 3.13, as this was the latest version in december 2024.
Each folder (`day01`, `day02`, ...) contains at least two files called `puzzle1.py` and `puzzle2.py`.
To run these, create a new file called `input` in the same folder and fill it with the contents of the given data (your
puzzle input).
Run these commands inside the folder to start the programs for part 1 and 2 of the puzzles:

```bash
py puzzle1.py
py puzzle2.py
```
