## Setup

First, you need to install Python 3.13, as this was the latest version in december 2024.
Each folder (`day01`, `day02`, ...) contains at least two files called `puzzle1.py` and `puzzle2.py`.
To run these, create a new file called `input` in the same folder and fill it with the contents of the given data (your
puzzle input).
Run these commands inside the folder to start the programs for part 1 and 2 of the puzzles:

```bash
py puzzle1.py
py puzzle2.py
```
